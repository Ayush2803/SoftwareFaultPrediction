# SoftwareFaultPrediction
Using machine learning and deep learning techniques for software fault prediction. 4 algorithms were tried- Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Networks. All of the algorithms have been implemented in python and shared here as ipynb notebooks. The datasets used were jm1 dataset and kc1 dataset provided by NASA's software MDP  program.
